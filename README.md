# eventmedia
Event Media Collection App

Samples to work from:

https://github.com/aws-samples/amplify-photo-gallery-workshop
https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-workshops/blob/master/ImageProcessing

Goal:
Build an app where people can have a simple url or a qr code to scan.
Once scanned, on a mobile device (or desktop), there is an easy interface to upload media.
That persons media, and anyone elses' from the event, are put into a portal that makes the images/videos consumable for all.

Thoughts:

Social media info for uploaders (if desired) - to allow people from the event to connect
facial recognition to find pic/videos of specific people or groups
sentiment - did people have a good time at the event?
timeline view
voting on best images/vids?
